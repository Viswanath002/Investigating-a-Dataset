# Investigating-a-Dataset
Introduction This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not the patients show up for the appointment based on characteristic of patient included in each row.  'Scheduled Day' tells us on which day patient set their appointment  'Neighborhood' tells us about the location of the hospital 'Scholarship' tells us whether the patient is enrolled in the welfare program
Questions
What features are important to know inorder to predict of a patient will show up for appointment or not.
Does the dataset contain any outliers or missing values to address.
Can we perform Dimensionality reduction based on correlation between features
Does any feature requires tranformation considering any outliers in the dataset

Following observation of data types from the dataset
Patient ID is of type - float
Appointment ID ,Age ,Scholarship,Hipertension, Diabetes,Alcoholism,Handcap,Sms_received is of type 'int'
Gender, Scheduledday,Appointment Day,Neighbourhood ,No -show is of type - 'string'

df['ScheduledDay'] = pd.to_datetime(df['ScheduledDay'])

df['AppointmentDay'] = pd.to_datetime(df['AppointmentDay'])
Converting Features to datetime format
ScheduledDay and Appointment Day features were found to be in wrong format but are now converted to datetime format

df.head(1) # The revised features with datetime format has been reflected in the below dataframe

Dealing with Outliers

df.hist(figsize =(15,15));
‚Äã

Histogram Observations
From the above graph we can interpret that data is not normally distibuted for various features
Appointment ID seems to reflect Left skewered distribution
Age feature seems to be show right skewered distribution
Observations from Outliers
'Age' feature seems to be skewered to the right because of outliers and needs to be normalised

np.sqrt(df['Age']).plot(kind = 'hist' , title = 'Histogram Distribution for Age' ,figsize = (8,5));
plt.xlabel('Distribution')
/opt/conda/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:1: RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in sqrt
  """Entry point for launching an IPython kernel.
Text(0.5,0,'Distribution')

Observation from above plot
The graph above reflects the Age feature now being tranformed to a normal distribution and all the skewness has now been removed

df['Age'].plot(kind = 'box' , title = 'Outlier Assesment')
plt.ylabel('years')
Text(0,0.5,'years')

Age feature outlier solution
The Age feature's outlier has been tranformed using sqrt function and the data now seems to be in normal distribution
The figure depicts 3 different types of quartile 75,50,25 the value which is present above 75 and below 25 seems to represent the outliers
The value present at the 50th quartile represents the mean

The scatterplot above reveals that there seems to be not much of a correlation between Age and Hipertension

Chi square test to determine correlation between Gender and No-show
Two categorical variable are said to be in correlation if the p-value was found to be (lesser than 0.05)

Conclusion
From the analysis it was found that Patient Age , Hipertension , Gender,Neighborhood would help us better to determine No-show appointment
The Dataset was found to have no missing values
'Age' was found to have outlier and right skewered but the same was normalized using transformation technique
Correlation for numerical and categorical features were analyzed and was found that we cannot remove any feature and require all to do further analysis

Limitations observed from Analysis
Correlation between numerical and categorical features were difficult to determine
Not able to check relationship between categorical variables diagramatically
Scatterplot cannot be used here to analyze since most of the features are categorical and only patient and appointment ID can be used for scatterplot since it is numerical
